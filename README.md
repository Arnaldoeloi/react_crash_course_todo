# React JS Crash Course


### Description
This project is a basic follow-up of the [React JS Crash Course, by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A) with slight changes. The reason why this exists here is simply to learn some concepts about React and how to consume data from an API with it.  


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
